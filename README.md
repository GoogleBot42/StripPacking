# StripPacking
Packs rects optimally into an infinitely long strip with a specfic width.

Install Love2D to see visual representation of the rects and make sure to add the define "#define USE_LOVE2D" to the top of main.cpp before the includes.

Without the USE_LOVE2D define the solutions are printed to the console.

To build and run simply do:

cmake .
make
cd Build
./Main
